	<ol>2. Here at Vivaldi, we try to keep things as simple and easy as possible but since this is a legal document, it’s a bit

		of Norway, except its conflict of laws rules and regulations. All disputes, actions or proceedings arising under or related
		to this EULA shall exclusively be referred and resolved by the Oslo City Court. Notwithstanding, nothing in this EULA will
		be deemed as preventing Vivaldi from seeking injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from any court having
		jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the dispute as is necessary to protect Vivaldi's proprietary information,
		trade secrets, know-how, or any other intellectual property rights.</ol>
