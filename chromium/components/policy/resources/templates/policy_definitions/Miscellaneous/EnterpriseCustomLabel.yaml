caption: Set a custom enterprise label
default: null
desc: |-
  This policy controls a custom label used to identify who managed a profile or browser.

  This label will be shown in the toolbar.

  If this policy is set at the browser level, all profiles will have this label in the toolbar.

  If this policy is set at the profile level, only that profile will have this label.

  Unlike other policies, this policy set at the profile level takes precedence over a policy set at the browser level.

  The custom label will not be translated.
