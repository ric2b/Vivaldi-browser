caption: Enterprise Logo URL
default: null
desc: |-
  A URL to an image that will be used as an enterprise badge for the profile. The URL must point to an image.

  This badge will be shown in the toolbar.

  If this policy is set at the browser level, all profiles will have this logo in the toolbar.

  If this policy is set at the profile level, only that profile will have this logo.

  If this policy is not set, a default building icon will be shown.

  If an error happens while trying to get and show the image, a default building icon will be shown.

  Unlike other policies, this policy set at the profile level takes precedence over a policy set at the browser level.
