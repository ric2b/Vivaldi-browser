// This class will implement the KAnonymityServiceDelegate by sending requests
// to the Chrome k-anonymity Service. For now this class only requests the
// trust token. In the future this class will send requests over OHTTP in order
// to anonymize the source of the requests. The requests are internally queued
// and performed serially.
//
// In the case of JoinSet this is necessary because we need
// to ensure that there is a trust token available to attach to the call, and
// the network service does not expose a method to get the count.
//
// In the case of QuerySets, requests are performed serially in order to
// simplify implementation. With only one request out at a time 1) it is clear
// which request the responses are associated with and 2) the limit on the
// number of outstanding requests can be handled by the caller.
//
// IDs passed into the KAnonymityServiceClient will be hashed with SHA256
// to convert them to a fixed size before being sent to the KAnonymity service.

  // token for rate limiting for each call, so we need to check that before
  // performing the OHTTP request (assuming we have the key). For now this
  // function only fetches the trust token without performing the request.
  //
  // The trust token interface (and network isolation configuration) assume
  // there exists both a "top frame" and a "current frame" for any requests.
  // The KAnonymityServiceClient makes requests in the background so those
  // concepts don't really apply here, but for the purposes of the interface we
  // choose to use the kKAnonymityAuthServer's origin as the origin for both
  // frames. Not only does this ensure that requests that can be cached are
  // cached with the appropriate isolation applied, but also avoids the less
  // common (and less tested) configuration where trust tokens are issued in a
