Requesting devices and device accessories is self-service using the tool
[HaRT (ChromeOS Hardware Asset Request Tool)](http://hart/). A comprehensive
walkthrough for making requests using this tool is documented at
go/ChromeDevDeviceReqHelp.

NOTE: HaRT requires membership in the [chromeos-acl](http://g/chromeos-acl)
group.

TIP: For Nooglers, it is recommended to request either "Eve" (Google Pixelbook)
and/or "Atlas" (Google Pixelbook Go) for "Google Code Name" under "SKU Features"
as a starting device.
