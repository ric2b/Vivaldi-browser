title: Running Custom Containers Under ChromeOS
---

Welcome to the containers project where we support running arbitrary code inside
of [VM]s in ChromeOS.
This is a heavily-technical document; for user-friendly information, see
[Set up Linux on your Chromebook
documentation](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439) and the
[ChromeOS developer site](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux).

If you're interested in hacking on [Crostini] itself, take a look at the
[Crostini developer guide](/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/containers/crostini-developer-guide/)

We won't get into technical details for specific projects as each one already
has relevant documentation.
We instead will link to them for further reading.

[TOC]

## Overview

There are many codenames and technologies involved in this project, so hopefully
we can demystify things here.

[Crostini] is the umbrella term for making Linux application support easy to use
and integrating well with ChromeOS.
It largely focuses on getting you a [Terminal] with a container with easy access
to install whatever developer-focused tools you might want.
It's the default first-party experience.

The [Terminal] app is the first entry point to that environment.
It takes care of kicking off everything else in the system that you'll interact
with.

[crosvm] is a custom virtual machine monitor that takes care of managing [KVM],
the guest [VM], and facilitating the low-level ([virtio]-based) communication.

[Termina] is a [VM] image with a stripped-down ChromeOS linux kernel and
[userland] tools.
Its only goal is to boot up as quickly as possible and start running containers.
Many of the programs/tools are custom here.
In hindsight, we might not have named it one letter off from "Terminal", but so
it goes.

[Concierge] is a daemon that runs in ChromeOS which handles lifecycle
management of VMs and containers and uses gRPC over vsock to communicate with
[Maitred].

[Maitred] is our init and service/container manager inside of the [VM], and is
responsible for communicating with [Concierge] (which runs outside of the [VM]).
[Concierge] sends it requests and [Maitred] is responsible for carrying those
out.

[Tremplin] is a daemon that runs in the [VM] to provide a gRPC wrapper for LXD.
This includes basic functionality such as creating and starting containers,
but also provides other [Crostini]-specific integration such as setting up
a container's primary user, and setting up apt repositories in the guest
to match the ChromeOS milestone.

[Cicerone] is a daemon that runs in ChromeOS which handles all communication
directly with the [VM] and container once the container starts running.
Specifically, it communicates with [Tremplin] (which runs inside of the [VM]),
and [Garcon] (which runs in a container inside the [VM]).

[Garcon] runs inside the container and provides integration with
[Cicerone]/Chrome for more convenient/natural behavior.
For example, if the container wants to open a URL, [Garcon] takes care of
plumbing that request back out.

[Seneschal] is a daemon that runs in ChromeOS that handles lifecycle management
of [9P] servers.  When [Concierge] starts a [VM], it sends a message to
[Seneschal] to also start a [9s] instance for that [VM].  Then, while configuring
the [VM], [Concierge] sends a message to [Maitred] instructing it to connect to
the [9s] instance and mount it inside the [VM].

[9s] is a server for the [9P] file system protocol.  There is one instance of
[9s] for each [VM] and it provides that [VM] with access to the user's data
stored outside the [VM].  This includes things like the Downloads folder, Google
Drive, and removable media.  The lifecycle of each [9s] instance is managed by
[Seneschal].  Each [9s] instance starts with no access to any files.  Access to
specific paths is granted by sending a message to [Seneschal], which makes the
requested path available to the specified [9s] instance.  Requests to share
paths can only be triggered by some user action.

[Sommelier] is a [Wayland] proxy compositor that runs inside the container.
[Sommelier] provides seamless forwarding of contents, input events, clipboard
data, etc... between [Wayland] applications inside the container and Chrome.

[Exo] is the Chrome [Wayland] server implementation. [Sommelier] communicates
with [Exo] using the [Wayland] protocol.

Chrome does not run an [X] server or otherwise support the [X] protocol;
thus [Sommelier] is also responsible for starting up [XWayland] (in rootless
mode), acting as the [X] window manager to the clients, and translating the
[X] protocol inside the container into the [Wayland] protocol for [Exo].

You can launch [crosh] and use the [vmc] command to create new [VM]s manually.
It will only run [Termina] at this point in time.
You can then use [vsh] to connect to a [VM] instance and use [LXC] to run
arbitrary containers.

The default container launched via [Terminal] is [Debian] with custom packages.
See [cros-container-guest-tools] for more details.

In this flow, the [VM] is named `termina` and the container is `penguin`.

## Quickstart

NOTE: See the [official Set up Linux on your Chromebook
documentation](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439) too.

Here's a quick run down of how to get started.

*   Buy a Chromebook!
    *   All devices launched in 2019 or later will support Crostini.
    *   See the [Device Support] section for more details.
*   Make sure your device is up to date.
    *   Check for [system updates] and reboot if needed.
    *   You do **not** need to put the device into developer mode.
*   Enable support.
    *   Open ChromeOS Settings
        *   Click the time, usually in the bottom-right corner of the screen,
            and then click the cog icon.
        *   Alternatively, press the Search/Launcher key and search for the
            Settings app.
    *   Scroll down to "About ChromeOS", then find the "Developers" section at
        the bottom of the page, and click "Set up" for the "Linux development
        environment"
    *   Turn it on!
*   Profit!

If you're interested in [Android Studio], check out their documentation too.

You may also want to pin to the shelf the [Terminal] or any graphical
applications you have installed for ease of access in the future.
This can be done by right clicking the app in the app launcher (press the
Search/Launcher key) or the shelf for an already-running application.

## Features

OK, so you've got your container going, but what exactly can you expect to work?

* Outbound network connections and inbound network connections when port
forwarding is enabled.
* Graphical applications, under either [Wayland] (preferred; via [Sommelier])
or [X] (compatibility via [Sommelier] and [XWayland]).
* Accelerated Graphics.
* Sound output and microphone capture.
* Access to certain USB devices
* Bidirectional file sharing with the host OS.
* And more!

### Missing Features

There are still many features we're working on fleshing out.

* Peripheral access (Bluetooth, [Camera](https://crbug.com/907701)/etc...).
* [IMEs](https://crbug.com/826614).

There are more things we're thinking about, but we're being very
careful/cautious in rolling out features as we want to make sure we aren't
compromising overall system security in the process.
The (large) FAQ below should hopefully hit a lot of those topics.

## Security

While running arbitrary code is normally a security risk, we believe we've come
up with a runtime model that sufficiently mitigates & contains the code.
The [VM] is our security boundary, so everything inside of the [VM] is
considered untrusted.
Our current [VM] guest image is also running our hardened kernel to further
improve the security of the containers, but we consider this a nice feature
rather than relying on it for overall system security.

In this model, the rest of the ChromeOS system should remain protected from
arbitrary code (malicious or accidental) that runs inside of the containers
inside of the [VM].

The only contact with the outside world is via [crosvm], and each channel
talks to individual processes (each of which are heavily sandboxed).

### User Data In The Container

With the shift to cloud services, current security thinking highlights the fact
that getting account credentials
(e.g. [your Google/Facebook passwords](https://xkcd.com/1200/))
is way more interesting than attacking your desktop/laptop.
They are not wrong.
The current [VM]/container ChromeOS solution does not currently improve on
this.
Put plainly, anything entered into the container is the responsibility of the
user currently.
So if you run an insecure/compromised container, and then type your passwords
into the container, they can be stolen even while the rest of the ChromeOS
system remains secure.

### Extracting Disk Images

Sometimes it's useful to be able to extract the disk image from a VM and move it
to another machine, either to recover the data if the VM won't start the normal
way, or to track down the source of a bug. This can be done from crosh, even on
non-dev mode devices, using the following command:

```bash
crosh> vmc export <vm name> <file name> [removable storage name]
```

Where `<vm name>` is e.g. `termina`, `<file name>` can be any file name, and
`[removable storage name]` is the drive label. Remember to quote this if the
name contains spaces e.g. `"My USB Drive"`. The backup will be stored either on
the removable storage specified, or in your Downloads folder if you didn't
specify one. The file is a gzipped tar archive of the raw VM disk image and can
be extracted and mounted on another system as follows:

```bash
tar -xzf <file name>
sudo mount -o loop <img file> /path/to/mount
```

The container data is then available at
`/path/to/mount/lxd/storage-pools/default/containers/penguin/rootfs`.

### Persistence

Processes in [VM]s and containers do not survive logout (since they live in the
user's encrypted storage) and are killed automatically.
They also do not automatically start at login (to avoid persistent attacks),
nor can they automatically run at boot (without a login session) since they
wouldn't be accessible (as they're in the user's encrypted storage).

### Executable & Writable Code

The [Termina] [VM] disk image is downloaded to the writable stateful partition
like other Chrome [component]s.
In order to make sure the contents aren't modified, we use [dm-verity].
This also means only images signed by Google may be loaded, and the image is
always read-only.

### Hardware Attacks

The Meltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities have implications for safely using [VM]s.
We've applied fixes/mitigations to make sure [VM]s can't attack the host system
or other [VM]s.
See the [ChromiumOS wiki page](http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/meltdown-spectre-vulnerability-status)
for more details.

## Lifecycles

Once you've got the [Terminal] installed (which takes care of installing all
the other necessary components like [Termina]), the system is ready to use.

By virtue of having things installed, nothing starts running right away.
In that regard, when you log out, everything is shut down and killed, and when
you log in, nothing is automatically restarted.

When you run the [Terminal], the [Termina] [VM] will be started automatically,
and the default [Crostini] container will be started in that.
You can now connect to the container via SSH or SFTP (via the Files app).

Similarly, if you run a Linux application directly (e.g. pinned to your shelf
or via the launcher), the [Termina] [VM] will be started automatically, and
the container that application belongs to will be launched.
There's no need to run [Terminal] manually in these situations.

When you close all visible applications, the [VM]/containers are not shut down.
If you want to manually stop them, you can do so via the [Terminal] app's
context menu, or via [crosh](#start-stop-vms).

Similarly, if you want to spawn independent [VM]s, or more containers, you can
do so via [crosh] and the [vmc] and [vsh] commands.

### Persistence

All the [VM]s and containers created, and the data within those containers,
will persist across user sessions (logout/login).
They are kept in the same per-user encrypted storage as the rest of the
browser's data.

If a [VM] or container are stopped or killed ungracefully (e.g. powerloss),
then data might be lost and need recovery like anything else in the system.

## Device Support

All devices launched in 2019 or later, as well as some devices launched earlier,
support Crostini. Any device which is [still receiving updates][AUE] currently
supports Crostini. There are no plans to backport support to devices which are
no longer receiving updates.

Enterprise admins have the [ability](#can-i-disable-these-features) to disable
Crostini access for devices which otherwise support it.

## FAQ

### Where can I chat with developers?

All ChromiumOS development discussions happen in our
[chromium-os-dev Google Group][chromium-os-dev].
Feel free to ask anything!

### Where can I file bugs and feature requests?

Please check the [existing bug list][known-bugs] as the issue may already be
known or fixed. You can star existing issues to receive updates.

If you want to send feedback, you can [file a feedback
report][feedback-report] and include `#crostini` in the description.
Feedback about any part of ChromeOS can be filed via "Alt-Shift-I".

If you want to file a bug, use [this link][new-bug] to route to the right
people. You may also want to also [file a feedback report][feedback-report]
and mention the bug number to send device logs that may aid debugging.

### When will my device be supported?

If your device does not already support Crostini, it is likely no longer
receiving updates and Crostini support will not be added.
See the [Device Support] section for more details.

### Do I need to enable developer mode?

There is no need to enable developer mode (where you see the scary screen at
boot about OS verification being turned off).
These features are all designed to run securely while your system is running
in normal/verified mode.

Unrelated to developer mode, some users may want to switch to the [dev channel]
to receive updates quicker.

### Can I boot another OS like Windows, macOS, Linux, *BSD, etc...?

Currently, no, you can only boot our custom Linux [VM] named [Termina].
See also the next few questions.

### Can I run my own VM/kernel?

Yes, we expose the `vmc` command via `crosh` (open search drawer -> `crosh`).

With this command, we expose some developer features, including the option to
boot a custom VM or [Termina] with your own kernel/initrd files.

`vmc start --kernel $KERNEL --initrd $INITRD termina`

where `$KERNEL` and `$INITRD` should be replaced with your own custom files. The
`vmc` command looks for those files in `MyFiles/Downloads`.

Once [Termina] has been booted with your own custom kernel, you can even start
containers inside it and verify for yourself they are running your kernel with
the `uname -a` command.

### Can I run a different Linux distro?

Of course!
The full LXD command line is available, and the included images remote has lots
of other distros to choose from.
However, we don't test with anything other than the default container that we
ship, so things may be broken when running another distro.

### I'm running \<insert distro here\>, how do I get {GUI apps, launcher icons, etc...}?

[Sommelier] and [Garcon] binaries are bind-mounted into every container, so no
need to install or cross-compile.
The systemd units and config files from [cros-container-guest-tools] will start
these daemons in a systemd user session.
It's also a good idea to run `loginctl enable-linger <user>` to allow these to
remain running in the background.

### Am I running Crostini?

If you're using the [Terminal] app, or programs in the default container we
provide that includes our programs to ease integration (e.g. [Sommelier]), then
yes.

If you're running your own container or [VM], then no.

### How do I share files between ChromeOS & the container?

The default Crostini container's storage is accessible under "Linux Files" in
the ChromeOS Files app.
Using [Secure Shell], you can set up a SFTP mount to the other remote
containers and then browse via the Files app as well.

Folders in ChromeOS can be shared to the container by right clicking them in
the Files app and selecting "Share with Linux". These will be shared under the
directory `/mnt/chromeos`.

### Can I access files when the container isn't running?

Currently, the container must be running in order to access its content.
The default Crostini container will be started automatically when "Linux Files"
is accessed from the Files app.

### Can I install custom kernel modules?

Currently, no, [Termina] does not include module support.
That means trying to use software that requires building or loading custom
kernel modules (e.g. VirtualBox) will not work.
See the next question too.

### Can I mount filesystems?

Currently, no (*).
The containers are implemented using Linux [user namespaces] and those are quite
restricted (by design).

See the [FUSE support entry](#FUSE) for alternatives.

(*): Technically you can mount a few limited pseudo filesystems (like
memory-backed tmpfs), but most people aren't interested in those.

### Is FUSE supported?

Yes! Note that unprivileged containers can't set up loopback mounts (see the
[next question](#can-i-use-loop-devices)), so your FUSE driver of choice can't
require a block device.

### Can I use loop devices?

Currently, no.
See the [previous question about mounting filesystems](#can-i-mount-filesystems).

Specifically, we're referring to `losetup` and `mount -o loop` which use
`/dev/loop-control` and nodes like `/dev/loop0` via the `loop` kernel module.

If you have a use case that wouldn't be solved by supporting [FUSE](#FUSE),
please [file a bug][new-bug] for us.

### Can I run a VM inside the VM?

Yes, on machines with kernels >= 4.19 nested virtualization is on by default.
However, performance will be slow if you don't have at least 8GB of RAM.
Currently, we don't have performance testing or guarantees for nested VMs.

### Can I run a container inside the container?

Yes!
You'll probably need to install the relevant packages first for whatever
container format you want to run.

### What container formats are supported?

[Termina] only supports running [LXC] directly.
For Kubernetes/Docker/OCI/rkt/etc... containers, see the previous question.

### What architecture works on my system?

Since everything is all native code execution, it depends on the device you
have.

If you don't know what device you have, you can find this out in two different
ways:

*   Open chrome://settings/help/details and look at the Platform,
    then match the board name with our public [device list].
    Look at the "User ABI" field to see what kind of CPU you have.
*   Open up [crosh] and run `uname -m`.
    This will print the architecture of your current device.

If you see `x86_64`, you'll be able to run code compiled for Intel/AMD
(32-bit/64-bit/x32 should all work).

If you see `arm` (or something similar like `armv7l`) or `aarch64`, you'll be
able to run code compiled for ARM/ARM64.

### Can I run other architectures?

There is currently no integrated support for running e.g. ARM code on an Intel
system, or vice-versa.
You could handle this yourself (e.g. by using qemu-user), but if you're familiar
with qemu-user, then you already know that :).

### How many VMs can I run?

You can spawn as many as your system can handle (RAM/CPU-wise).
They are all independent of each other.

### How can I manually start/stop VMs from crosh?

You can start and stop a [Termina] VM instance with `vmc start <VM name>` and
`vmc stop <VM name>`, respectively. The name of the default VM instance is
`termina`.

### How can I create/destroy multiple VMs?

You can create and destroy a VM with `vmc create <VM name>` and `vmc destroy <VM
name>`, respectively. Also, you can see the list of existing VMs with `vmc
list`.

### How can I run VMs with data images on external storage?

You can run a VM with a disk image on external storage such as an SD card or a
USB stick.

If your USB stick is shown as `USB Drive` in the Files app, you can create an
extra disk image there with the following command:

```bash
# Allocate a 1GB data image on the inserted USB stick.
crosh> vmc create-extra-disk --size=1G extra-disk.img "USB Drive"
A raw disk is created at /media/removable/USB Drive/extra-disk.img.
```

Then, you can start a VM with the disk image mounted.

```bash
# Make sure the VM instance is stopped.
crosh> vmc stop termina
# Pass the image path with `--extra-disk` option to `vmc start`.
crosh> vmc start termina --extra-disk "/media/removable/USB Drive/extra-disk.img"
```

The extra disk will be mounted at `/mnt/external/0/` in the guest.

### How many containers can I run?

You can spawn as many as your system can handle (RAM/CPU-wise).
Each [VM] instance can host multiple containers.

### Can I run programs that keep running after logout?

Nope!
All [VM]s (and their containers) are tied to your login session.
As soon as you log out, all programs are shut down/killed by design.

Since all your data lives in your encrypted home, we wouldn't want that to
possibly leak when you log out.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Can I autorun programs when I log in to ChromeOS?

Nope!
All [VM]s (and their containers) need to be manually relaunched.
This helps prevent persistent exploits.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Can I autorun programs when I boot?

Nope!
See the previous questions, and the [Security] section.

### Can I set environment variables for my container?

Sure! There are a few ways to do this.

*   [environment.d] lets you set environment variables for your `systemd --user`
    session, which includes the [Terminal] and all GUI apps.
*   If you just want environment variables in your [Terminal], set those in your
    shell's config file, such as `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

Changes to environment variables only take effect for newly started programs.
You may also need to restart programs or the entire container for any changes to
take effect.

[environment.d]: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/environment.d.html

### Is multiprofile supported?

No, [Terminal] is only supported in the primary profile (*).
We don't plan on making secondary profiles more featureful.

If you're unfamiliar with [multiprofile] support, check out the general
[multiprofile documentation][multiprofile] for more details.

(*): The [Terminal] and other installed GUI applications are disabled in
secondary profiles. Users can manually start [VM]s via [crosh] and containers
therein, but the UI and Files app integration may not work correctly.

### Are child accounts supported?

No, [Terminal] is not supported in [child accounts].
We don't have plans to make this available to such accounts.

### Are my VMs/containers/data synced/backed up?

Currently, no, nothing is synced or backed up.
You're responsible for any data going into the containers.

### How can I backup a VM?

The Crostini container can be backed up and restored via ChromeOS Settings.
Manually created containers and VMs can be backed up with standard [LXC]
commands and [`vmc export`](#extracting-disk-images) respectively.

### Can I access the VM/container files directly (e.g. via the Files app)?

Currently, no, there is no way to access the image files used by the [VM].
There are no plans to change this.

If you want to back things up, you'll need to do so by hand.

### Why is the time inside the VM/container out of sync?

The clock inside of the [VM] (and by extension, the containers) is
automatically kept in sync with ChromeOS's clock.
So you do not have to run time keeping services yourself (e.g. ntp).
That clock is based off of [UTC].

We attempt to sync timezone data into the container via
[timedatectl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/timedatectl.html).
If that doesn't work, we fallback with exporting the `TZ` environment variable.

We don't currently update the timezone details inside the [VM] itself.
We also don't try to update any other timezone setting as they are non-standard
across distros.
So the time might appear to be wrong at a glance in those environments, or stale
if the `TZ` environment variable is used.

See [this bug](https://g-issues.chromium.org/issues/40570539) some extended
technical details.  It's more complicated than you might think!

### What copy & paste, and drag & drop formats are supported?

While [X]/[Wayland] support an arbitrary number of [MIME] formats, [Exo], the
ChromeOS [Wayland] server, accepts only the formats that Chrome itself does for
clipboard copy & paste, and drag & drop.

Clipboard items copied via Chrome, or drags started in Chrome will use formats:
*   text as `text/plain;charset=utf-8`, `text/plain;charset=utf-16`, and
    `text/plain` (using UTF-8 encoding).
*   html as `text/html;charset=utf-8`, and `text/html;charset=utf-16`.
*   copy & paste images as `image/png`.
*   drag & drop image file contents as
    `application/octet-stream;name="<filename>"`.
*   files as `text/uri-list` which is a CRLF-separated list of `file:` URLs.

[Exo] accepts the following formats from VM [Wayland] apps:
*   text as `text/plain;charset=utf-16`, `text/plain;charset=utf-8`,
    `text/plain`, and `UTF8_STRING`.
*   [RTF] as `text/rtf`.
*   html as `text/html;charset=utf-16`, `text/html;charset=utf-8`, `text/html`.
*   images in many formats including `image/png` and `image/jpeg`.
*   files as `text/uri-list` which is a CRLF-separated list of `file:` URLs.

You can see the details of what Chrome will offer in [exo/data_offer.cc], and

### Can I read/write the clipboard automatically from inside the VM?

Currently, no.

From a security point of view, we don't want untrusted code silently or
automatically extracting whatever the user has copied.
Perhaps your browser session is copying personal data or passwords.
It's the same problem that the [web platform][web-copy-paste] runs into.

This is not the same thing as users manually pasting data (e.g. Ctrl-V).
This is only about programmatic reading.

We don't expect it to stay this way forever.
Once we have a permission model and UI to manage these things, we can look into
allowing users to grant this permission.

If you use `xclip` or [X] tools, they often have a local buffer (in [XWayland]),
but it won't automatically sync with the rest of the system.

### Do I have to manage VM updates?

Nope!
The [Termina] [VM] is a [component] that is updated automatically.

Keep in mind that the [VM] is separate from the container.

### How do I check the Termina version?

The [Termina] version is tied to the ChromeOS version and updated at the same
time. ChromeOS's version can be seen at `chrome://version`, and will look
something like `14324.72.0`.

You can also connect to a [VM] via [vsh] and run `cat /etc/lsb-release`.

### Do I have to manage container updates?

The Google provided packages in the container that communicate with ChromeOS
or are required for ChromeOS integration will be automatically updated on a
regular basis.
This will install/upgrade any necessary dependencies automatically.

Package updates due to security fixes will automatically be installed for you.

There is no automatic upgrading of other installed packages in the container.
We'd rather avoid updating packages that might break programs already installed.
The container is like any other Linux distro out there, so you'll need to update
it from time to time if you want newer software.
But if you're happy with things as they are, and stable is better than shiny,
then you don't need to worry about ever having to manually manage the system.

If you're looking for a quick recipe to pull in the latest shiny versions, run
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`.

If you want to control any automatic package updates, edit the file
`~/.config/cros-garcon.conf`.
It is automatically installed for new users, and includes documentation inline.
**Be warned**: disabling automatic updates can break integration with CrOS.

When a new major version update to Debian is available and tested, users are
prompted by ChromeOS and provided with UI to upgrade the container. If you want
to upgrade before this is available, you can do so manually.

### Can I use IPv6?

Yes. Both dual-stack and IPv6-only networks are supported.

ChromeOS only supports SLAAC; read more in the support page for [IPv6 support
on ChromeOS].

[IPv6 support on ChromeOS]: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9211990

### Can I access layer 2 networking?

Currently, no, networking access is only at layer 3 (i.e. IP).
So you won't be able to do any bridging or lower level fun stuff.

It's not clear if/when this will change.
Bridging with the outside world is difficult with WiFi, and not many devices
have Ethernet connections.
We could support layer 2 between containers, but it's not clear how many people
want this in order to justify the effort involved.

### Do VPNs set up by CrOS/Android (outside of the VM/containers) work?

[Yes](https://crbug.com/834585)!

### Is audio output supported?

Yes!

### Is audio capture (e.g. microphone) supported?

[Yes](https://crbug.com/932268)! There is a toggle in ChromeOS Settings to
enable this.

### Can I access hardware (e.g. USB/Bluetooth/serial)?

USB support for some devices, including Android devices and serial devices, is
available via ChromeOS Settings. Direct Bluetooth access is not available but
you could use the Web Bluetooth API with a web server running in Crostini.

### Can I run graphical applications?

Of course!

### Can I run Wayland programs?

Yes, and in fact, these are preferred!
Chrome itself deals with [Wayland] clients heavily, and so you're much more
likely to have things "just work" if you upgrade.

[Sommelier] provides this support seamlessly.

### Can I run X programs?

Yes, although you might run into some compatibility kinks, and it probably will
never be as perfect as running a traditional [X] server.
However, with the wider community moving to [Wayland], it should be good enough.

[Sommelier] takes care of launching [XWayland], acting as the [WM], and
otherwise translating [X] and [Wayland] requests between Chrome and the
[X] programs.

### Why are windows sometimes tiny/fuzzy?

While Chrome supports [high DPI][HiDPI] displays, many Linux applications don't.
When a program doesn't properly support [DPI] scaling, poor results follow.

Currently we expose the native resolution and [DPI] directly to applications.
If they show up tiny or fuzzy, it's because they don't support scaling properly.
You should report these issues to the respective upstream projects so that,
hopefully someday, it'll "just work".

In the mean time, [Sommelier] exposes some runtime settings so you can set the
scale factor on a per-program basis to work around the misbehavior.
Check out [Sommelier]'s documentation for more details.

If you're applying a system-wide zoom or otherwise changing the default display
resolution, we attempt to scale the application output to match.
This can lead to blurry results.
You can adjust the resolution of your display, or tweak things via [Sommelier]
(see above for more details).

### Will synergy work?

[Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) will not work (as a client or server).
It requires capturing and spoofing inputs (e.g. mouse/keyboard) for all windows.
Since we're built on top of [Wayland], by design, one client cannot get access
to any other client on the system.
This is a strong security boundary between clients as we don't want arbitrary
code running inside of a container being able to break out and attack other
clients (like the browser) and sending arbitrary keystrokes.

There are no plans to ever enable this kind of control from the container.
This isn't to say a synergy-like solution will never happen in ChromeOS
(e.g. something like [CRD](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1649523)),
just that the solution won't be synergy or any other tool in a container.

NOTE: You can run synergy, and probably get it to convey input events for the
single window that it's running under, but that's as close as you'll get.

### Can I run Windows programs?

Sure, give [WINE] a try.
Compatibility will largely depend on [WINE] though, so please don't ask us for
support.

### Can I run Steam?

Some Chromebooks now already support [Steam] separately. If your device is one of
them, it's recommended you run [Steam] without Crostini, just follow the
instructions on [this
page](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/14220699?).

Alternatively, if you want to run it inside Crostini, you can just install it
normally like any other Linux app following the instructions on Valve's website.

### Can I run macOS programs?

Probably not.
You could try various existing Linux solutions, but chances are good that they
are even rougher around the edges.

### Can I develop Android apps (for ARC++)?

Check out the [Android Studio] site for more details on this.

### Why implement crosvm from scratch (instead of using QEMU/kvmtool/etc...)?

We have nothing against any of these other projects.
In fact, they're all pretty great, and their designs influenced ours.
Most significantly, they did more than we needed and did not have as good a
security model as we were able to attain by writing our own.
While [crosvm] cannot do everything those other projects can, it does only what
we need it to.

For more details, check out the [crosvm] project.

### Why run VMs?  Aren't containers secure?

While containers often isolate themselves (via Linux [namespaces]), they do not
isolate the kernel or similar system resources.
That means it only takes a single bug in the kernel to fully exploit the system
and steal your data.

That isn't good enough for ChromeOS, hence we put everything inside a [VM].
Now you have to exploit [crosvm] via its limited interactions with the guest,
and [crosvm] itself is heavily sandboxed.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Are Android apps (ARCVM) going away?

There are no plans to merge the two projects.
We share/re-use a lot of the Chrome bridge code though, so it's not like we're
doing everything from scratch.

### Don't VMs slow everything down?

It is certainly true that [VM]s add overhead when compared to running in only
a container or directly in the system.
However, in our tests, the overhead is negligible to the user experience, and
well worth the strong gains in system security.

For more details, see the [Security] section in this doc.

### Why run containers inside the VM?  Why not run programs directly in the VM?

In order to keep [VM] startup times low, we need [Termina] to be as slim as
possible.
That means cutting out programs/files we don't need or are about.

We use [dm-verity] which requires the [Termina] image be read-only for
[Security], but it also means we can safely share it between [VM] instances.

Further, the versions of programs/libraries we ship are frequently newer than
other distros (since we build off of [Gentoo]), and are compiled with extra
security flags.

Allowing user modifications to the [VM] prevents a stateless image that always
works and is otherwise immune from user mistakes and bugs in programs.

Altogether, it's difficult to support running arbitrary programs, and would
result in a system lacking many desired properties outlined above.
Forcing everything into a container produces a more robust solution, and
allows users to freely experiment without worry.

Also, [we love turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).

### Is Foreshadow (a.k.a. L1TF / CVE-2018-3646) handled?

Yes.
For more details, see our
[public documentation](https://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/containers-update).

### Can I delete containers I no longer want?

Sure, feel free to delete whatever you want.
However, there is no UI or commands currently to help with this.

Note: The default [Crostini] container is named `penguin`.

### Can I delete VMs I no longer want?

Sure, feel free to delete whatever you want.
The `vmc destroy` command can be used to delete them manually.

Note: The default [Crostini] [VM] is named `termina`.

### Can I disable these features?

Administrators can control access to containers/[VM]s via the management
console, so enterprise/education organizations that want to limit this can.
If Crostini access is disallowed, Crostini's "Turn On" button in
ChromeOS Settings will be greyed out.

### Why the name Crostini?

It's a play off [crouton] which is a project to easily create full Linux
environments (including developer tools) for users who turned on developer mode.
[Crostini] aims to satisfy the majority of use cases covered by [crouton], and
is a larger & tastier snack than a crouton, hence the name.

### How is Crostini related to Crouton?

[crouton] helped define many of the use cases that developers wanted with
ChromeOS, so it helped guide [Crostini] from a requirements perspective.
We wanted to make sure that the majority of [crouton] users would be able to
use [Crostini] instead for their needs, but in a secure environment.

So [crouton] helped inspire the direction of [Crostini], but no code has been
shared or reused between the two.
It's not that [crouton] is bad, it's simply a completely different model.
