// option for all supporting types. And there are a lot of context menu providers that support
// `SDK.NetworkRequest.NetworkRequest`, for example `Override content` by PersistenceActions, but we so far just want
// the one to reveal in network panel, so add a new class which will only be supported by Network panel. Also we want to
// have a different behavior(select the network request) from the `SDK.NetworkRequest.NetworkRequest` (highlight the
// network request once).
