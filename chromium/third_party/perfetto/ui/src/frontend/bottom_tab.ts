// The implementations of this class are provided by different plugins, which
// register the implementations with bottomTabRegistry, keyed by a unique name
// for each type of BottomTab.
//
// Lifetime: the instances of this class are owned by BottomTabPanel and exist
// for as long as a tab header is shown to the user in the bottom tab list (with
// minor exceptions, like a small grace period between when the tab is related).
//
// BottomTab implementations should pass the unique identifier(s) for the
// content displayed via the |Config| and fetch additional details via Engine
// instead of relying on getting the data from the global storage. For example,
// for tabs corresponding to details of the selected objects on a track, a new
// BottomTab should be created for each new selection.
