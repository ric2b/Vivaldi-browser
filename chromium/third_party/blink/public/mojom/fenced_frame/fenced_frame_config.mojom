// The `FencedFrameConfig` struct is used to transfer a redacted version
// (`blink::RedactedFencedFrameConfig`) of `content::FencedFrameConfig` from the
// browser process, to the renderer process, where the redaction process is
// specific to whether the target renderer is either a fenced frame's embedder
// or a frame inside the fenced frame tree. For more documentation on the
// redaction process, see the comments above `content::FencedFrameConfig`. In
// brief, this is a collection of properties that the browser process exposes to
// an embedder that may wish to load into a fenced frame. The config will
// determine the fenced frame's behavior, but it may have certain fields
// redacted (marked as opaque) in order to preserve privacy. For example:
// * This object is returned to the caller of APIs that use fenced frames,
//   so that they can inspect the (unredacted) information inside and then
//   load it into a fenced frame.
// * When nested frames are declared in the above APIs, the top-level
//   frame will be given access to these objects in order to load the nested
//   configs.
