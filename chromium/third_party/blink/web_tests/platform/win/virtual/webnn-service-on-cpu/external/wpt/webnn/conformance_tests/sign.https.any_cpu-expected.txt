This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] sign float16 1D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'sign' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type float16 for argument input, must be one of [float32, int32]."
[FAIL] sign int64 3D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'sign' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for argument input, must be one of [float32, int32]."
[FAIL] sign int8 4D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'sign' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for argument input, must be one of [float32, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
