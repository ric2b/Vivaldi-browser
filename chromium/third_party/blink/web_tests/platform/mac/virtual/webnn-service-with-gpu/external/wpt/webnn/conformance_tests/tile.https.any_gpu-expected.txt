This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] tile float32 1D constant tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'tile' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type float32 for argument input, must be one of []."
[FAIL] tile uint32 2D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, int8, uint8]."
[FAIL] tile int32 4D tensor
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'tile' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int32 for argument input, must be one of []."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
