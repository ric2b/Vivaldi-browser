This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] [prelu] Test with  input's dataType = int8 and slope's dataType = int8.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [prelu] Throw if the data type of input is int64.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int64 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
[FAIL] [prelu] Throw if the data type of input is uint32.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'input' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for input operand named 'input', must be one of [float32, float16, int32]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
