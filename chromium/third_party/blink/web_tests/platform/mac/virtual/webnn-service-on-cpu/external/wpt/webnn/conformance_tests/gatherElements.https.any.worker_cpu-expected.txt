This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] gatherElements float32 2D input and uint32 indices options.axis=1
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, int8, uint8]."
[FAIL] gatherElements float32 3D input and int32 negative indices
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'gatherElements' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type float32 for argument input, must be one of []."
[FAIL] gatherElements float32 1D input and uint32 out-of-bounds indices
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'cast' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint32 for output, must be one of [float32, float16, int32, int8, uint8]."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
