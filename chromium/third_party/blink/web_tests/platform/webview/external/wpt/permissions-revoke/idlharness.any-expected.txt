This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Permissions interface: operation revoke(object)
  assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "revoke" missing
[FAIL] Permissions interface: navigator.permissions must inherit property "revoke(object)" with the proper type
  assert_inherits: property "revoke" not found in prototype chain
[FAIL] Permissions interface: calling revoke(object) on navigator.permissions with too few arguments must throw TypeError
  assert_inherits: property "revoke" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
