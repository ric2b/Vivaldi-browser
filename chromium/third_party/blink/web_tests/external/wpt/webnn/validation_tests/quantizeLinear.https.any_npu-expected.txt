[FAIL] assert_not_equals(navigator.ml, undefined, "ml property is defined on navigator")
  assert_not_equals: ml property is defined on navigator got disallowed value undefined
[FAIL] [quantizeLinear] Test scale's shape = [3, 2, 5] and zeroPoint's shape = [3, 2, 5] which is the same as input's shape.
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: MLGraphBuilder is not defined"
[FAIL] [quantizeLinear] Test scale's shape = [5] and zeroPoint's shape = [5] which is unidirectionally broadcastable to input's shape.
