PASS idl_test setup
PASS idl_test validation
PASS Partial interface ElementInternals: original interface defined
PASS Partial interface ElementInternals: member names are unique
PASS ElementInternals includes ARIAMixin: member names are unique
PASS CustomStateSet interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS CustomStateSet interface object length
PASS CustomStateSet interface object name
PASS CustomStateSet interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS CustomStateSet interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS CustomStateSet interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
FAIL CustomStateSet interface: setlike<DOMString> assert_equals: clear function object length should be 1 expected 1 but got 0
PASS CustomStateSet interface: operation add(DOMString)
PASS CustomStateSet must be primary interface of customStateSet
PASS Stringification of customStateSet
PASS CustomStateSet interface: customStateSet must inherit property "add(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS CustomStateSet interface: calling add(DOMString) on customStateSet with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS ElementInternals interface: attribute states
Harness: the test ran to completion.
