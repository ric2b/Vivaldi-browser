<h1>Canvas2D WebGPU Transfer: canvas-works-after-cpu-downgrade</h1>

<p>WebGPU access should work normally on a canvas which has been downgraded to
CPU, transparently bringing it back to the GPU.</p>

<canvas id="c" width="50" height="50"></canvas>

<script>

// Note that only HTMLCanvasElement-based canvases are automatically downgraded
// to CPU rendering, so we don't have a matching OffscreenCanvas test here.
promise_test(() => {
    return with_webgpu((adapter, adapterInfo, device) => {
      test_canvas_works_after_cpu_downgrade(adapterInfo,
                                            device,
                                            document.getElementById('c'));
