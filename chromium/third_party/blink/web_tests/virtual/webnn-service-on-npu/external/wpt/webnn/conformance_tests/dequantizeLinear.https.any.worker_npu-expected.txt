This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear int8 0D tensor with float32 scalar scale
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'dequantizeLinear' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for argument input, must be one of []."
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear uint8 1D constant tensor broadcasting zeroPoint
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'dequantizeLinear' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type uint8 for argument input, must be one of []."
[FAIL] dequantizeLinear int8 4D constant tensor broadcasting scale and zeroPoint
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'dequantizeLinear' on 'MLGraphBuilder': Unsupported data type int8 for argument input, must be one of []."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
