management tasks, including:

Local Modifications:
_ Added this file.
_ Added BUILD.gn
_ Removed requirements.txt from google-auth-library-python and
  google-auth-library-python-httlib2's .kokoro dependency. The
  requirements listed there are not used by Catapult and were causing false
  positives when checking Python dependency versions.
