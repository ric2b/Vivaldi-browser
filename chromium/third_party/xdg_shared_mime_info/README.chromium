Description:
File freedesktop.org.xml.in synced from

generate.py will fetch the latest version of the xml file from the freedesktop
repo and save it to this dir, and generate mime_cache.gen.cc.

This script can be run from time to time as the freedesktop database is updated.
About once a year or so would be fine since the database does not change often.
If there are missing or wrong values, we should first try to get changes
accepted upstream.

Local Modifications:
No modifications, but after running this script, you may need to run
`git cl format` and possibly add some `nocheck` comments.
