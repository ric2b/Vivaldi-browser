Description:
The Android NDK provides libraries and tools necessary for building, running,
and debugging C/C++ on Android. However, as Chromium builds its own toolchain,
this directory only contains the following artifacts from the NDK:

1. simpleperf
2. sysroot
3. lldb and lldb-server

This allows us to use tracing and gdb support, while limiting our dependencies.

Local Modifications:
* Removed files in the sysroot that conflict with other files when unzipped on
  case-insensitive filesystems (e.g. usr/include/netfilter/xt_CONNMARK.h).
