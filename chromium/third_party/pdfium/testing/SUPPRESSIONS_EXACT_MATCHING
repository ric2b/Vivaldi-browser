# List of tests to use fuzzy instead of exact matching, one per line.
# There are four space-separated columns per line
# Each column (except column 0) can contain a comma-separated list of values.
#
# Column 0: test file name
# Column 1: platform: *, win, mac, linux
# Column 2: v8 support: *, nov8, v8
# Column 3: xfa support: *, noxfa, xfa
# Column 4: rendering support: *, agg, gdi, skia
#
# All columns on a line on a line must match, but filenames may be repeated
# on subsequent lines to suppress more cases.  Within each column, any one of
# the comma-separated values must match in order for the colum to "match".
# The filenames and keywords are case-sensitive.
#
# Try to keep the file alphabetized within each category of test.
