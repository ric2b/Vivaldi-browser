      <description summary="assign a role to this surface">
        Assign a role to a shell surface.

        The compositor handles surfaces depending on their role.
        See the explanation below.

        This request fails if the surface already has a role, this means
        the surface role may be assigned only once.

        == Surfaces with splash role ==

        Splash surfaces are placed above every other surface during the
        shell startup phase.

        The surfaces are placed according to the output coordinates.
        No size is imposed to those surfaces, the shell has to resize
        them according to output size.

        These surfaces are meant to hide the desktop during the startup
        phase so that the user will always see a ready to work desktop.

        A shell might not create splash surfaces if the compositor reveals
        the desktop in an alternative fashion, for example with a fade
        in effect.

        That depends on how much time the desktop usually need to prepare
        the workspace or specific design decisions.
        This specification doesn't impose any particular design.

        When the startup phase is finished, the shell will send the
        org_kde_plasma.desktop_ready request to the compositor.

        == Surfaces with desktop role ==

        Desktop surfaces are placed below all other surfaces and are used
        to show the actual desktop view with icons, search results or
        controls the user will interact with. What to show depends on the
        shell implementation.

        The surfaces are placed according to the output coordinates.
        No size is imposed to those surfaces, the shell has to resize
        them according to output size.

        Only one surface per output can have the desktop role.

        == Surfaces with dashboard role ==

        Dashboard surfaces are placed above desktop surfaces and are used to
        show additional widgets and controls.

        The surfaces are placed according to the output coordinates.
        No size is imposed to those surfaces, the shell has to resize
        them according to output size.

        Only one surface per output can have the dashboard role.

        == Surfaces with config role ==

        A configuration surface is shown when the user wants to configure
        panel or desktop views.

        Only one surface per output can have the config role.

        TODO: This should grab the input like popup menus, right?

        == Surfaces with overlay role ==

        Overlays are special surfaces that shows for a limited amount
        of time.  Such surfaces are useful to display things like volume,
        brightness and status changes.

        Compositors may decide to show those surfaces in a layer above
        all surfaces, even full screen ones if so is desired.

        == Surfaces with notification role ==

        Notification surfaces display informative content for a limited
        amount of time.  The compositor may decide to show them in a corner
        depending on the configuration.

        These surfaces are shown in a layer above all other surfaces except
        for full screen ones.

        == Surfaces with lock role ==

        The lock surface is shown by the compositor when the session is
        locked, users interact with it to unlock the session.

        Compositors should move lock surfaces to 0,0 in output
        coordinates space and hide all other surfaces for security sake.
        For the same reason it is recommended that clients make the
        lock surface as big as the screen.

        Only one surface per output can have the lock role.
