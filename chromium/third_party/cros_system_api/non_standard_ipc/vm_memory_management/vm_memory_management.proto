// VmMemoryManagement Protocol Overview
//
// A VM client of the VmMemoryManagementServer must open two connections to the
// server. The first connection is the kills connection and handles initiating
// kill requests from the client to the server and receiving kill decisions from
// the server. The second connection is the stats connection which *must be
// handled on a separate thread from the kills connection*. The stats connection
// is used to inform the server of the client's MGLRU stats when a new
// generation is created and also when the server requests the client's stats.
//
// Key:
// '<-' client message to the server
// '->' server message to a client
//
// Kills connection:
// <- HANDSHAKE(Connection Type: KILLS)
// CONNECTION_ACK ->
// (
//   (
//     <- KILL_REQUEST
//     KILL_DECISION ->
//     <- KILL_REQUEST_LANTENCY
//   )|(
//     <- NO_KILL_CANDIDATES
//   )
// )*
//
// Stats connection:
// <- HANDSHAKE(Connection Type: STATS)
// CONNECTION_ACK ->
// (
//   (
//     <- MGLRU_RESPONSE
//   )|(
//     MGLRU_REQUEST ->
//     <- MGLRU_RESPONSE
//   )
// )*
//
// Note: Since the stats thread has both server initiated and client initiated
// communication, there is a race between the client sending an un-prompted
// MGLRU_RESPONSE at the same time as the server sends a MGLRU_REQUEST. This
// race is acceptable because unlike a kill request, there is no correlation
// between a specific MGLRU request and an MGLRU response. The response just
// represents the best effort MGRLU stats at that point in time.
