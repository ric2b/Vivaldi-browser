<histogram name="OfflineIndicator.ConnectivityChanged.DeviceState.Offline"
    enum="OfflineIndicatorSurfaceState" expires_after="2022-01-16">

  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>sinansahin@google.com</owner>
  <owner>twellington@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    For OfflineIndicatorV2, records whether the native browser controls can be
    animated and whether the omnibox is focused. Recorded when the device goes
    offline.
  </summary>

<histogram name="OfflineIndicator.ConnectivityChanged.DeviceState.Online"
    enum="OfflineIndicatorSurfaceState" expires_after="2021-05-09">
  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>sinansahin@google.com</owner>
  <owner>twellington@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    For OfflineIndicatorV2, records whether the native browser controls can be
    animated and whether the omnibox is focused. Recorded when the device goes
    online.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflineIndicator.CTR" enum="OfflineIndicatorCTREvent"
    expires_after="2021-01-25">
  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jianli@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records events related to click through rate (CTR) calculation for Offline
    Indicator UI. The CTR can be calculated by computing Clicked/Displayed.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflineIndicator.ShownDurationV2" units="ms"
    expires_after="2022-04-17">
  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration the offline indicator was shown. Recorded when the offline
    indicator stops being shown. There are two differences between this
    histogram and OfflineIndicator.ShownDuration: 1) the maximum bucket size and
    total number of buckets are higher in this histogram, and 2) this histogram
    is persisted in perfs. The second point means that if the user backgrounds
    then kills Chrome when the Offline Indicator was shown, then we will still
    record a sample. Note that in this case, when the user opens Chrome again
    and if the Offline Indicator is shown, then it will be treated as a
    continuation from before Chrome was killed.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.AccessPageCount"
    enum="OfflinePagesNamespaceEnumeration" expires_after="2022-08-28">
  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts the number of times an offline page is accessed. Events are reported
    per offline pages namespace.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.Background.ImmediateStart.AvailableRequestCount"
    units="units" expires_after="2021-06-25">
  <owner>dougarnett@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Number of queued background load requests available for processing when
    processing starts immediately (vs. scheduled). This is for non-svelte
    devices (where svelte is determined by base::SysInfo::IsLowEnd()).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.CachedOfflineStatusValid" enum="BooleanMatched"
    expires_after="2024-05-26">
  <owner>pnoland@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether the offline page status cached for a given tab agrees with the true
    value. Recorded with 1/100 probability each time the offline status for a
    tab is checked.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.DidNavigationThrottleCancelNavigation"
    enum="Boolean" expires_after="2024-05-19">
  <owner>curranmax@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>tbansal@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether or not the OfflinePageNavigationThrottle canceled a navigation
    request. Requests are only canceled if and only if the navigation request
    was initiated by the renderer and the request headers contain the
    &quot;X-Chrome-offline&quot; header.

    This histogram is recorded each time Chrome tries to create an
    OfflinePageNavigationThrottle, which only happens on Android (since Offline
    Pages is only enabled there).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.OfflineUsage" enum="OfflinePagesOfflineUsage"
    expires_after="2023-08-13">
  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts user-days when Chrome was used in specific ways regarding navigation
    to online and offline content. Buckets are mutually exclusive so that only
    one bucket is incremented per reported day. This metric is not recorded to
    UMA immediately due to potential data loss while offline. So day counters
    are persisted to prefs and reported to the histogram only when the next UMA
    data upload is likely to succeed. For more details see:
    https://goo.gl/GJXwFe.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.OfflineUsage.NotOfflineResilient"
    enum="OfflinePagesOfflineUsage" expires_after="2022-04-17">
  <owner>sclittle@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Counts user-days when Chrome was used in specific ways regarding navigation
    to online and offline content. Buckets are mutually exclusive so that only
    one bucket is incremented per reported day.

    This metric is a mirror of OfflinePages.OfflineUsage but it doesn't use any
    of the offline resilient mechanisms that one has. Ideally both should report
    exactly the same values but it is expected this one will lose more samples.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram base="true" name="OfflinePages.PageAccessInterval" units="minutes"
    expires_after="2021-08-29">
  <owner>dimich@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>offline-dev@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Length of time between accesses to an offline page. This is the same time
    period used for expiring temporary pages. This metric is recorded when an
    offline page is accessed.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="OfflinePages.WebsiteSettings.OpenOnlineButtonVisible"
    enum="BooleanVisible" expires_after="M77">
  <owner>fgorski@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether Open online was visible in Page Info popup, when it was
    shown for an offline page. (The button is visible only when Chrome is
    connected when the Page Info popup is opened for offline page.)
  </summary>
